	Introduction

This is a real-time, non-relocating, conservative, Treadmill allocator.

TM interleaves marking, scanning and sweeping during each call to tm_malloc().

TM attempts to limit the amount of scanning, marking and collecting
during each call to tm_alloc() to avoid stopping the world for long
periods of time.
