	Introduction

This is a real-time, non-relocating, conservative, Treadmill allocator.

TM interleaves marking, scanning and sweeping during each call to tm_malloc().

TM attempts to limit the amount of scanning, marking and collecting
during each call to tm_alloc() to avoid stopping the world for long
periods of time.

    To Do

* Implement allocations larger than tm_block_SIZE.
* Implement aligned allocations using a page-indexed bit vector.
** Flag a bit for the beginning page of the aligned block.
** Use a hash table to map the address of the aligned block to a tm_block containing its own tm_type.
